Description: A data manager meant to avoid manual storage/retrieval of
    data to/from the file system. It builds one (or more) centralized
    repository where R objects are stored with rich annotations,
    including corresponding code chunks, and easily searched and
    retrieved. See Napolitano (2017) <doi:10.1186/s12859-017-1510-6> for further
    information.

Description: This is an R data manager meant to avoid manual storage/retrieval
    of R data to/from the file system. It builds one (or more) centralized
    repository where R objects are stored with annotations, tags, dependency notes,
    provenance traces. It also provides navigation tools to easily locate, load and
    edit previously stored resources.

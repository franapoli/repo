Description: This package implements an R objects repository manager. Instead of manually storing and retrieving R objects into and from the appropriate directories, repo offers an abstraction layer that takes care of sorting the objects. For each stored object, the user provides a name, a description and a list of tags. Repo will store the object together with all the metadata an provide easy access to it. Repo can display a compact list of all the items stored and provide search by tags, load in the workspace, remove from disk, export to RDS files, edit metadata, manage provenance traces.

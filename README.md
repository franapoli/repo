*Thou Shalt Not save() or load()*

Store your R data files in a central repository on your disk, together
with tags, annotations, provenance and dependence information. Find
and load any saved objects easily through the repo interface, without
remembering its position on the disk.

This README file is in progress: please check out the getting started
guide at (http://franapoli.github.io/repo).
